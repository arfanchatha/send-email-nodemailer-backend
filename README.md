If you need to send 10 files to 10 different recipients, each with the same subject for example ("Salary Transferred") and body ("Salary for the month..."), but with different attachments, here's how you can automate the process:

1. **File Naming**: If the file format is pdf, ensure each file is named with the recipientâ€™s email address, such as `name@gmail.com.pdf`.

2. **Automated Process**: The application will extract the email address from each file name and attach the corresponding file to the email.

3. **Batch Processing**: You can process all files and send the emails with a single click.

This approach streamlines sending multiple personalized emails with their respective attachments efficiently.
